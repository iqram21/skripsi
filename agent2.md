# Dashboard UI Update Request

## Project Context
I have an Electron application with authentication pages (login and register) that have a modern UI design. The dashboard page needs to be updated to match the same modern design and color scheme.

## Current Files
- Dashboard HTML: `d:\Electron_Terbaru\frontend\pages\dashboard.html`
- Login page reference: `d:\Electron_Terbaru\frontend\pages\login.html`
- Register page reference: `d:\Electron_Terbaru\frontend\pages\register.html`

## Requirements

### 1. Design Consistency
- Match the visual style of login and register pages
- Use the same color scheme and typography
- Maintain consistent spacing and layout patterns
- Use card-based design similar to login/register forms

### 2. Modern UI Elements
- Add smooth transitions and hover effects
- Include modern card layouts with shadows
- Add proper spacing and padding
- Use consistent button styles from other pages
- Implement responsive design

### 3. Dashboard Features to Include
- User welcome section with profile information
- Device information display (matching other pages)
- Statistics or activity cards
- Quick action buttons
- Navigation sidebar or top navigation bar
- User settings/profile section

### 4. Color Scheme (from login/register)
- Use the same background gradient/color
- Match card backgrounds and shadows
- Consistent button colors and states
- Same text colors and hierarchy

### 5. Additional Elements
- Add icons for better visual appeal
